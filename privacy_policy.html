        <h1>File Time Lock Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            At File Time Lock, your privacy is a top priority. We are committed to safeguarding the confidentiality
            and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect
            data related to your use of our application.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            File Time Lock does not collect any personal or sensitive data from its users. We do not gather
            information such as names, email addresses, location data, or any other personal identifiers.
        </p>

        <h2>File Access and Locking</h2>
        <p>
            Our app's sole purpose is to enable the locking and unlocking of files based on your preferences.
            The files you choose to lock are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers
            or any third-party entities.
        </p>

        <h2>Internet Time Sync</h2>
        <p>
            File Time Lock may access the internet to synchronize time accurately, ensuring that locked files
            are unlocked only after the designated time period has passed. This process does not involve the
            collection of any personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not utilize any analytics or tracking mechanisms within our app. Your usage patterns, interactions, and
            any other actions within the app remain solely on your device and are not shared with us or any external
            parties.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>File Time Lock requires minimal permissions to function effectively, such as access to your device's storage
            to lock and unlock files. These permissions are solely for the purpose of providing you with the intended
            functionality of the app and are not used for any other purposes.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute any data from our users, as we do not collect any personal or
            user-related information. Your files and interactions within the app remain completely private and within
            the confines of your device.</p>

        <h2>Updates and Changes</h2>
        <p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be reflected on this page. It is recommended that you review this
            policy periodically for any updates. Continued use of the File Time Lock app after changes signifies your
            acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
