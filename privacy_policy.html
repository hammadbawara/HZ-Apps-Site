        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>At File Time Lock, your privacy is of utmost importance to us. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality
            and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect the data related
            to your use of our application.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Collection:</h2>
        <p>File Time Lock does not collect any personal or sensitive data from its users. We do not gather information such as
            names, email addresses, location data, or any other personal identifiers.</p>
        
        <h2>File Access and Locking:</h2>
        <p>Our app functions solely to facilitate the locking and unlocking of files based on the user's preferences. The files
            you choose to lock are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers or any third-party
            entities.</p>
        
        <h2>Internet Time Sync:</h2>
        <p>File Time Lock may access the internet to synchronize time accurately, ensuring that locked files are unlocked only
            after the designated time period has passed. This does not involve the collection of any personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>Analytics and Tracking:</h2>
        <p>We do not utilize any analytics or tracking mechanisms within our app. Your usage patterns, interactions, and any
            other actions within the app remain solely on your device and are not shared with us or any external parties.</p>
        
        <h2>Permissions:</h2>
        <p>File Time Lock requires minimal permissions to function effectively, such as access to your device's storage to lock
            and unlock files. These permissions are solely for the purpose of providing you with the intended functionality of
            the app and are not used for any other purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Sharing:</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute any data from our users as we do not collect any personal or user-related
            information. Your files and interactions within the app remain completely private and within the confines of your
            device.</p>
        
        <h2>Updates and Changes:</h2>
        <p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be reflected on this page. It is recommended that you review this policy
            periodically for any updates. Continued use of the File Time Lock app after changes signifies your acceptance of the
            updated policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact Us:</h2>
