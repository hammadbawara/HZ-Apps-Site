        <h1>App Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information
            related to your use of our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            We collect minimal data to enhance the appâ€™s performance and provide better services to you. Below is a
            summary of the data we collect and its purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Collected for analytics and to improve app performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Used to analyze and enhance app stability.</li>
            <li><strong>App Performance Data:</strong> Monitored for improving user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>File Name:</strong> Collected solely for analytics purposes. We do not collect or access the
                contents of your files.</li>
            <li><strong>App Interactions:</strong> We track user actions within the app for analytics purposes to
                improve functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>File Access</h2>
        <p>
            While using the app, file names are collected for analytical purposes to help us understand app usage
            patterns. However, we do not collect or access the contents of your files in any way.
        </p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The app may require storage access to allow for basic functionality, such as interacting with your local
            files. These permissions are used only for the purpose of the app and never to gather personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or distribute any personal data. The limited data we collect is used internally to
            improve app performance and user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            We may use third-party services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) for analytics, crash reporting, and
            improving app performance. These services may collect aggregated data that does not directly identify you.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for any
            changes. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes your agreement to the revised policy.
        </p>
